# Flow Meter with Arduino

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

> In this project, you able to measurement gases like Oxygen, Nitrogen with industrial reliability - only using the Arduino and this code.

* ### Arduino

* ### ADS1115 - Analog to Digital Converter

* ### Flow Sensor - galvanic cell

------------------------

## Advantages

> Although I've used Delay(), the code has a fast reading of the sensor. Besides, the exponential filter to ADS1115 can filter noises and the code has the flexibility to change the gain of the ADS1115.

------------

## Status

> This project was the result of prototyping. Although the code works well, I`m organizing the project to implement in companies. Therefore at the next level, I will be doing Macro, Class, and health check algorithm.
